## Dark Zen color scheme
* Toned-down syntax highlighting for C++. Makes easy to analyze the code, and quickly find method calls and class variables.
* Includes styling for Resharper C++ and Unreal Engine elements.
* I was using this scheme with VS 2017 and 2019. However, work on Visual Studio is abandoned.
* Currently I'm using the Rider scheme. The text background has been adjusted to the [Xcode-Dark](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13106-xcode-dark-theme) theme.
